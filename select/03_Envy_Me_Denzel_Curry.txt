I'mma keep balling, 'til they envy me
21 guns, for my enemies
Niggas got some, ho ass tendencies
Cash out, I'm ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause, I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
Up in Carol City, me and
Lotto in the Charger, when we slide two deep
(Two deep) can't fuck with the south with
A AK-forty-seven bumping T Double-D
(Double D, nigga)
First forty-eight, gotta say it one time
RIP my nigga Bizzle (Bizzle!, , bizzle)
Kick, drill, ravish of a
Nigga think he savage
Turn him to a popsicle that's "IcecoLD!"
And my last name ain't three-thousand (3000)
Bad ass bitch on my tip
(Tip Harris) , she wet
Like an everlasting fountain
Still a Hot Boy, ‘bout whatever
Like, Turk or Wayne
Like a motherfuckin' Carter
Niggas water whipping, in the hot damn
Kitchen, like a nigga Avatar, or Katara
Remember that it's still fuck the
Other side, lurking all black
Like that boy Plies
Snapping, like a fat ho at the Popeye's when
She don't get the thigh, the chicken
Or the fries so nigga what it be? I can turn
My shirt to a ski, fuck feds, not even Ice T
Wanna come and ice me, like it's New Jack
City, shit looking grim - no Mandy, billy
Cross the chopper line bitch
You better bow down to a
Nigga greater than yourselftrick
Flow is immortal, so therefore I gorde
You do something of it for yourselftrick
From the 'Tre deuce, got to
Keep a deuce deuce
Like a nigga lurking in South Cen TRU
(South Central) bruh, if you bout that
Pressure cross that line
Fuck nigga state your issue my nigga
I'mma keep balling, 'til they envy me
21 guns, for my enemies
Niggas got some, ho ass tendencies
Cash out, I'm ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause, I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
Behold these verses
The stars to the churches will
All metamorph into seven
I'm rocking 'bout four types of polo
You peep that my style it must be Armageddon
Apocalypse stop, pop the clip
Better bow down now it's all about power
Fantasy darker than Swishers
The wicked demented
Get hit with the mystical shower
Now that's dan-ger grab, on the ban-ger
Take down the empire bruh
In the hood jit's robbin', like Williams
Let's hope that they'll never doubt fire
Niggas be knocking no cabbage, no UPS person
So tell me what's up with the S?
Slithery snakes, with they slithery tongues
Salivating salvations with shit on your head
Yes, Curry gone mash on these cowards
With shells to they back like they Bowser
Spit fire - no flower get smoke
Like the OG and sour then head up to Broward
You know when the bass turn up
Louder, 'bout loud as the dro
Get to the door
I'm shroomed out my mental, like Mario Bros
I'm seeing the walls start to kaleidoscope
So I'm guessing that already
Means that I'm gone
It's quite striking that
Haters won't tell the truth in
Front of your face
Not the same time, not the same place
So they hate from a greater distance far away
You see them in person look 'em in the eye
And they say that that wasn't the case
Y'all can suck a dick in advance
Like Rich Homie Quan
Get the fuck out my facebitch
I'mma keep balling, 'til they envy me
21 guns, for my enemies
Niggas got some, ho ass tendencies
Cash out, I'm ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
My enemies, motherfuck my enemies
Cause, I'ma keep ballin', til they envy me
