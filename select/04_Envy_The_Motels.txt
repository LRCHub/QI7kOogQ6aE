Everybody wants my body
Everybody wants my man

Looks so fine
Tomatoes on the vine
Everybody wants my man

You better leave him alone
You better leave him alone

Everybody wants my car
Everybody wants my ride
So they can drive all around like I drive
Everybody wants my car

You better leave it alone
You better leave it alone
Alright alright

Everybody wants my money
Everybody wants my cash
So they can live in a style like my style
Everybody wants my cash

You better leave it alone
You better leave it alone
You better leave it alone
You better leave it alone
Alright alright
