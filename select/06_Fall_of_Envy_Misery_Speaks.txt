Fall of envy in days of serenity
Through the bleeding eyes of insanity
Bound for darkest evil are hatred.
Feeding the hatewolf with flesh of human kind!
Demons eroding the inside.
Your misery spreaks the truth.
Bound for silent cruel reflections.
Chasing sun which is melting my eyes.
Step in the soul of those who believe
All of the lies and all the disease
Stab in the soul of those who let god
Unhinging minds so tear them apart
No blood! No soul!
We bring the storm!
To strike 'em down the once unkown.
We bring the storm!
Step in the soul of those who believe
All of the lies and all the disease
Stab in the soul of those who let god
Unhinging minds so tear them apart
Trapped in fire you will never see the day.
Burn down in suffering in ashes you may stay.
Trapped in fire you will never know my name.
Living in the casket of another man
