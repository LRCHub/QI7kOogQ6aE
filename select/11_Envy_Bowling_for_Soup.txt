I found your Poison T-shirt, look what the cat dragged in
Seems like it was yesterday
I remember when we said the word forever
But thats all over now

We used to be the envy
We used to be the talk of
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town
We used to be the ones who everyone thought would make it
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town
Whenever I'm sober I say to myself
It sucks that its over, but at least we gave it hell

Our friends always gave us shit
For being so in love
King and queen of the PDA
We kissed until the sun came up
And you were gone
We never said goodbye

We used to be the envy
We used to be the talk of
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town
We used to be the ones who everyone thought would make it
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town
Whenever Im sober I say to myself
It sucks that its over but at least we gave it hell

Time keeps moving on
Our chances are all gone
To follow through with all we said we'd do
So I sing the eulogy
To the ghost of you and me
And drink another beer

The sun went down
And you were gone
We never said goodbye

We used to be the envy
We used to be the talk of
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town
We used to be the ones who everyone thought would make it
We used to be the best thing about this fucking town

And when I'm not sober I say to myself
Maybe I should call her and wish her the best
But I remember its over
And this feels like fucking hell
